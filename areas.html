    Cambodia is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Cambodian adults and children migrate to other countries within the region and, increasingly, the Middle East for work; many are subjected to sex trafficking or forced labor on fishing vessels, in agriculture, construction, factories, or domestic servitude.

    Nepal has a large number of people forced into free labor or prostitution locally but more often shipped to India where they are also subjected to the same treatment and conditions.

    Haiti’s trafficking schemes are mainly focused on children who come from impoverished rural regions. These children are voluntarily being sent to wealthier households with hopes of better lives and education, where they enter a system of forced servitude instead. This can happen with or without paid middlemen
