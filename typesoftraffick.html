      <h1>Types of Trafficking</h1>
      
    <p style="text-indent: 50px">It is important to recognize that despite their distinct definitions, sex and labor trafficking often overlap in real trafficking situations.
    </p>

      <h2>Labor Trafficking</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <div class="info">
    <ul>
    <li>Forced labor, or involuntary servitude, is the biggest sector of trafficking in the world, according to the U.S. Department of State.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: A family gives up a child to an adoption agent in Nepal because they cannot afford to care for him. He is then, in turn, sold to a sweatshop owner who forces the child to learn to sew garments without pay for hours each day. The child receives minimal nutrition and does not attend school.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Debt bondage is another form of human trafficking in which an individual is forced to work in order to pay a debt.</li>
    
      <ul>
      <li>Example: A young woman from Russia has amassed grave credit card debt and is desperate to pay it off. A man who identifies himself as an employment agent offers her a job in the United States as a domestic employee.  She arrives in the San Francisco with a valid visa but it and her passport and taken from her. She is brought to a home where her movement is restricted. She is then told that she must work as a housekeeper to pay off the cost of her travel or her family will be killed.</li>

      </ul>
      <li>A notable subcategory of labor trafficking, child soldiering occurs when a person under the age of 18 is made to be a combatant in a national army or rebel militia.</li>

      <ul>
      <div class="invisible">
        <li>Example: the “Invisible Children” forced to fight for the Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group originally from Uganda.

    <h2>Sex Trafficking</h2>
    <div class="info">
    <ul>
      <li>Sex trafficking occurs when a person is made to perform commercial sexual acts through force, fraud, and/or coercion.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>According to federal law, any minor under the age of 18 engaging in commercial sex is a victim of sex trafficking, regardless of the presence of force, fraud, or coercion.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Sex traffickers frequently target vulnerable victims and then use violence, threats, lies, debt bondage, or other tactics of control and manipulation to keep victims involved in the sex industry.</li>  
    <ul><li>Sex trafficking is a market-driven criminal industry that is based on the principles of supply and demand. Buyers of commercial sex increase the demand for the industry and provide a profit incentive for traffickers. By not participating in the commercial sex industry, community members can reduce the demand for sex trafficking.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Organ Trafficking</h2>
    <div class="info">
      <ul>
     <li>Although not officially recognized by the US government as a form of human trafficking, the UN and a number of foreign governments include forced removal of human organs for sale on the black market as a “service” under the heading of labor trafficking.</li>
    <li>In many countries, waiting lists for transplants are very long, and criminals have seized this opportunity to exploit the desperation of patients and potential donors. The health and lives of victims are at risk as operations may be carried out in hazardous conditions with no medical follow-up.</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Example: In February 2016, Al Jazeera helped break up a three person trafficking ring in Indonesia. Villagers in West Java, around 30 individuals, had sold their kidneys to the tune of $5,000 apiece. Selling organs is illegal in Indonesia, but people can donate them to friends and relatives. To sell his kidney, 39-year-old Midun had to pretend that he knew the recipient of his kidney well, acting as a donor. A middleman changed his age to 25 to increase his chances of being accepted.</li>
